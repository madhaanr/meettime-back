Simple Node.js bootstrap with Express and ES6 / ES2015. [Heroku deployment](https://simple-node-bootstrap.herokuapp.com)

# General
This is the backend version of the Angular bootstrap that I made. Something to guide you out when creating your backend and not sure how to do it. It's simple as the title says and it's mostly a recollection of things that I've learned and seen to be useful.

# How to install
1. Install Node.js and nvm if you don't have them by now. Newest versions suit very well. 4.-something if you want the production-stable version. Basically it should work if you write ```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.4/install.sh | bash``` to your terminal. Then ```nvm install 6.3.1``` and maybe ```nvm use 6.3.1```.
2. Clone this repository and go to the root and enter ```npm i``` or ```npm install```.
3. This app uses dotenv for storing environment variables, rename the ```.dev-env``` file in the root of this folder to ```.env``` and anytime you want to use Travis or Heroku remember to add your variables to their config. Or for your own server create your own production ```.env```.
4. This app uses MongoDB as database so you need to either install MongoDB locally or use [mlab](https://mlab.com). I recommend mlab for its easy of use.
5. For better development experience it's recommended to use Postman for generating requests to your app. [Here's a link to Chrome. plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop) For making requests you should set your content-type to application/json and if you have authentication enabled remember to add X-Access-Token -header with valid token.
6. Now you're all set, enter ```npm start``` to run the development server.
7. Go to localhost:3332 if you want to see the backend running. Not much to look at though.

# Commands to remember
1. ```npm i <library> --save``` or ```npm i <library> --save-dev```
2. ```npm test```
3. ```npm run lint``` or ```npm run lint:fix```
4. ```npm run db reset``` for resetting database, other usable commands ```db add, db destroy, db dump```

# Structure
This app uses basic MVC with services as global helpers. Feel free to make changes and create better solutions. I was going to add option to use postgres but eh mayber later. Also sorry about the very sad test suite.

Also I've made bit leaky error reporting to end-user (sends stack traces to everyone), but it shouldn't matter unless you want to use it in production.
